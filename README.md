## Biography
Hey everyone, my name is Nick and I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in clinical/research neuropsychology at UDeM. The principal objective of my thesis is to better understand functional alterations (fMRI & functional connectivity) occuring in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or MCI and subjective cognitive decline or SCD). I obtained my undergraduate diploma in psychology in 2015 and henceforth I'm not used to coding. Prior to this summerschool, I had made 2-3 graphs with R but that was pretty much it. I'm presently writing my thesis and looking for a post-doc (I will actually miss a part of the 4th week for a post-doc interview, VERY excited about it!!). I'm also beginning my first clinical internship at the Institut universitaire de gératrie de Montréal in September 2019 (so, pretty soon) while my second clinical internship will take place at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute in March 2020.
